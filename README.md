# News Aggregator Project

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, staying updated with the latest news from various sources can be a time-consuming task. With the abundance of information available on the internet, users often find it challenging to efficiently gather news articles from their preferred sources while filtering out irrelevant content. This inefficiency can lead to information overload and difficulty in accessing timely and relevant news updates. 

To address this issue, the development of a Python-based news aggregator with web scraping techniques is proposed. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application that automates the process of fetching news articles from a diverse range of sources, allowing users to customize their news consumption experience.
