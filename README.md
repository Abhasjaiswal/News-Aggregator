Travel planning involves more than just tracking fluctuating flight prices. We aim to create an automated system that comprehensively monitors price variations and tracks diverse factors impacting the overall travel experience. Users provide details like departure city, destination city, dates, and more. The system conducts periodic assessments, comparing prices from various sources and considering elements such as service quality, amenities, and user reviews. Users can access information not only about significant price drops but also optimal booking times matching their preferences, allowing for a comprehensive decision-making process that goes beyond cost considerations.

## Objectives:

- Leverage Selenium for web scraping to extract HTML content and retrieve real-time data from multiple airline sites.

### Data Extraction and Analysis:

- Utilize Beautiful Soup to parse HTML content and extract relevant details, including flight prices, services, and additional features.
- Standardize the extracted data and store it in a structured format (database or CSV) for seamless analysis.

### Periodic Price Checks:

- Develop a scheduling mechanism for periodic price checks based on user-defined intervals.
- Implement trend analysis by comparing current prices with historical data to identify optimal booking windows.

## Tools and Technologies:
